edits for scraper.py
âœ… What it does:
Returns a list of mock job postings based on criteria like salary and location.
Filters out jobs below your minimum salary requirement.
It includes key fields like status, notes, and cover_letter_sent so that downstream components can manage and track these jobs properly.
ðŸ”§ Future Improvement:
Replace the mock data with actual job board API integration (e.g., Indeed, Remote OK, or Greenhouse).
You could use libraries like:
requests + BeautifulSoup for scraping
selenium for dynamic pages

for ai_helper
Environment Variable Required
Be sure to set your API key in your terminal or .env file before running:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
